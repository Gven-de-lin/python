#Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. 
# See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
# break=5

#Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. 
#Now calculate your age using these two variables
birth_year = 2002
currently_year = 2023
years = currently_year - birth_year
print (years)

#Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables
first_name = "Anfisa"
middle_name = "Novykova"
last_name = "Valeriivna"
print (first_name + ' ' + middle_name + ' '+ last_name)

#Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue
# Invalid variable is 1record, record-one, record^one.
